Description: This package contains functions to define a network with source vertice, intermediary vertices, and exit vertice.
    You can simulate flow through this network where edges determine the time of the traversal from one vertice to next one.
    It was initially created to simulate vaccine centre as a graph and then calculate the human flow through the centre.
    Additionally, it contains functions to test the settings beforehand. 
    Check the expected throughput and highlight the weak spots.
